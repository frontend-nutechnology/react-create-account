Welcome to the NU Technology frontend coding challenge! Please read the following instructions carefully.

**Your goal is to set up an React application which enables the user to view and manage contact listing page.**

# Business need

The main goal is for the user to add, view and delete contacts.


# Use cases

- The user shall be able to:
  - Create new contact with name and phone number
  - Add empty validations for both name and phone number
  - Upon successful the contact should get's added to the existing list
  - Should clear/reset the contact from once it's addedd successfully
  - Each contact on the list should have a delete button
  - Clicking on the delete button should remove the contact from list

Note:- The interactions should not refresh the page.

# Demo Page

## Create Account Form
![Alt text](./assets/demo.png?raw=true "Title")

## Create Account Form with show passowrd clicked
![Alt text](./assets/demo_with_show_password.png?raw=true "Title")

## Create Account Form without show passowrd
![Alt text](./assets/demo_without_show_password.png?raw=true "Title")

# Evaluation criteria

## Technology requirements

**React** and **JavaScript** are mandatory requirements. Apart from this, you can use any libraries, task runners and build processors. ES6 and TypeScript are highly encouraged.

## Code requirements

The full criteria for evaluating the coding challenge can be found [here](./Criteria.md).

# How to submit

- If you are using https://codesandbox.io/
  - In the menu section go to File -> Export to ZIP
  - Email the zipped file to your point of contact.

- If you are developing on your machine
  - Clone this repository.
  - Complete your project as described above within your local repository.
  - Ensure everything you want to commit is committed before you bundle.
  - Create a git bundle: `git bundle create your_name.bundle --all`
  - Email the bundle file to your point of contact.

**In order to be fair to all candidates, please refrain from sharing your solution on public repository hosting services such as GitHub and Bitbucket.**

# Time limit

There is no hard time limit for this coding challenge. However, we believe that 30mins - 1 hour is sufficient for the must-have parts of the application. While we appreciate all the effort put into the challenge, we also do not want to take up too much of your time. Our advice is to focus on making sure [that the application works properly and has some tests](Criteria.md#must-have) before moving on to secondary objectives.

Good luck,
The NU Technology Team
